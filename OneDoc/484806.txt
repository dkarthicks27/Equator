Docket No. RP00-336-000, et al. Technical Conference

Question No. 1:  Could a shipper go directly from a receipt point rather than a pool, or use a mixture of both, under El Paso's proposal?  

Response No. 1:  El Paso's proposal uses pooling areas as receipt points and does not contemplate any allocation of CD or BD volumes to specific receipt points into the system.  Once implemented, however, this proposal would allow a shipper to nominate transportation on a primary basis from a specific receipt point located within its pooling area.  El Paso would be interested in receiving input as to how many shippers would, if given the option, elect to be allocated rights at a specific receipt point rather than in a pooling area.
