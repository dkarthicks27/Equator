I don't know.  I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters.  Sorry I am so clueless.  MHC

I am working with Jeanie Slone on the Bridgeline rollover.  In working on the 401K plan, I need to know whether the Texaco/Enron employees will be treated as Terminated or will they fall under the Same Desk Rule. 

Thanks,
