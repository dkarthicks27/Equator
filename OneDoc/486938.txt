To Whom It May Concern:


Event America is an extremely promising and well-positioned start up. The core management team has tremendous industry knowledge and contacts. They are positioned to offer compelling content for local through to national events, brand marketing and merchandise sales to targeted groups. There is no other competitor that can offer this full range of event marketing in a user-friendly ASP solution. 

Prior to my career in executive search, I was VP Marketing for an international publicly traded company. We used many services in order to pull together our corporate event marketing and executive event marketing efforts. This fragmented approach cost us time and money on top of our $2million event budget. If there had been a service like Event America available we would have utilized it without question. 

As an executive recruiter my team and I see hundreds of start up companies. We only choose to work with those with exceptional core teams, strong business models, and a clear plan to achieve their objectives. Event America has all the components we look for in start up companies. In addition, Eliot Barton and Jim McKay have the type of entrepreneurial spirit, coupled with extremely relevant histories of success. 

I am quite certain that with the appropriate funding and additional core team, Event America will become the one stop shop for VIP Hospitality, Event eCommerce and Content. 

Sincerely,
