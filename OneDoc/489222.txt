John,

The reason they are high is because they are not population weighted.  This makes a significant difference, looking at 10 cities at 100% versus population weighted, where all of the cities in a region add up to 100%.

If you would like me to weight them, it would not be a problem.

Sachin,

These HDD's look a little too high.  I pulled just 5 cities and they are more than the spreadsheet that you prepared for the fundy's site.  Could you look at them to verify.  Thanks.
