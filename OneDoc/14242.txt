Tara,

This response was not from me - it was from Ann Hicks in Houston who is the 
unfortunate person who receives a large number of mails destined for me 
because the sender is careless when sending their message.

Many Thanks

Ann

Anne,

You didn't write any message on your response, so I am not sure if you have a 
futures trading account or not.  Is that why you responded to Mark's email?

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ENA,s NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications 
require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents 
have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other 
related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with 
another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany 
email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business Friday, June 30, 
2000 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest 
in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading 
affiliate account).

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS REQUEST.
