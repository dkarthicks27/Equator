Terms of Transaction. 
Transaction Type:  Cooling Degree Day (“CDD”) Swap.
Calculation Period: The period from and including the Effective Date to and including the Termination Date. 
Payment Date(s): The fifth Business Day after the Floating Amount for the Calculation Period is determinable, provided, however, that a one time adjustment in the amount paid will be made by the appropriate party, if applicable, if the Reporting Agency makes any correction or adjustment to the reported daily maximum and minimum temperatures within 95 days of the end of the Calculation Period for any day within the Calculation Period. 
Fixed Amount Payer: (a) Enron if the terms set forth on the Website relevant to the Transaction provide that Counterparty is ‘Selling’ and (b) Counterparty if the terms set forth on the Website relevant to the Transaction provide that Counterparty is ‘Buying’.

Floating Amount Payer:(a) Enron if the terms set forth on the Website relevant to the Transaction provide that Counterparty is ‘Buying’ and (b) Counterparty if the terms set forth on the Website relevant to the Transaction provide that Counterparty is ‘Selling’.

Floating Amount: The sum of CDD’s calculated in accordance with the procedure detailed below, for each day during the applicable Calculation Period. If more than one Reference Weather Station is specified for a Transaction, then the Floating Amount will be the weighted average of the sum of CDD’s for each such Reference Weather Station during the applicable Calculation Period using the percentage set forth next to such Reference Weather Station for weighting. If no percentage is so specified, then the weighting shall be equal.
For a Reference Weather Station, CDD for each day is equal to the greater of (i) the non-rounded average of the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures in Reference Degrees from and including 9:00 AM on that day to and including 8.59 AM on the next day local time as measured by Reporting Service, and reported by the Reporting Agency, for the Reference Weather Station minus the Reference Basis or (ii) zero. 

Reporting Service: The Bureau of Meteorology of the Commonwealth of Australia established under the Meteorology Act 1955 or its successor organisation.

Reporting Agency: National Climate Centre of the Reporting Service.

Rounding Convention: Degrees Celsius rounded to one decimal place as follows: if the second number after the decimal point is five (5) or greater then the first number after the decimal point shall be increased by one (1), and if the second number after the decimal point is less than five (5) then the first number after the decimal point shall remain unchanged.

LST: References to time are as reported by the Reporting Agency at the relevant RWS or FRWS.

Fallback Reference Weather Station (“FRWS”):	If for any day during the Calculation Period a daily maximum or daily minimum temperature is unavailable for the Reference Weather Station (“RWS”) then the missing temperature(s) for that day at such RWS shall be calculated in accordance with the following procedure: 
The daily maximum (if the missing temperature is a daily maximum) or daily minimum (if the missing temperature is a daily minimum) temperature for the corresponding day of each of the previous 30 years at such RWS shall be identified as reported in degrees Celsius by the Reporting Service (which numbers as reported by the Reporting Service shall not be rounded by the parties) and an average temperature shall be determined, which average temperature shall be rounded using the Rounding Convention; 
In accordance with the above procedures, the daily maximum or daily minimum temperature as appropriate shall be determined for the corresponding day of each of the previous 30 years at  the Fallback Reference Weather Station ( or in the event such data is not available, from the closest geographical location that publishes data for that period as reported in degrees Celsius by the Reporting Agency (which numbers as reported by the Reporting Agency shall not be rounded by the parties) and an average temperature shall be determined, which average temperature shall be rounded using the Rounding Convention;
The average temperature generated in (ii) above shall be subtracted from the average temperature generated in (i) above (with the resulting number (whether positive or negative) referred to as the "Average Temperature Difference Number"); 
The daily maximum or daily minimum temperature as appropriate for the corresponding FRWS for the day for which the daily maximum or daily minimum temperature is missing for the RWS shall be identified as reported in degrees Celsius by the Reporting Agency (which number as reported by the Reporting Agency shall not be rounded);and 
The temperature determined in (iv) shall be adjusted by adding the Average Temperature Difference Number if it is a positive number and subtracting the absolute value of the Average Temperature Difference Number if it is a negative number, with the resulting number being rounded in accordance with the Rounding Convention.  The final number determined in (v) shall be deemed the daily maximum or daily minimum temperature as appropriate for the RWS for the relevant day and shall be the number used to make the calculations as required pursuant to the procedures set forth in the “Floating Amount” above.


Data Sources:  The data used to determine the Floating Amount (and to the extent required, data for the FRWS) shall be obtained from the “Daily Temperature and Climate Archive” of  the Reporting Agency or any successor thereto. To the extent that the Reporting Service data is corrected or adjusted within 95 days of the end of the Calculation Period then the adjusted or corrected number(s) shall be obtained from the "Daily Temperature and Climate Archive" of the Reporting Agency or any successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Reporting Agency does not issue data for the RWS, then the procedures set forth under "Fallback Reference Weather Station(s)" shall be utilised to determine the missing data.

Strike Amount Differential: The amount equal to the Floating Amount minus the Strike Amount.

Payment Amount:  Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement to the contrary, if the Strike Amount Differential is a:
positive number, the Floating Amount Payer shall pay the Fixed Amount Payer an amount in the Contractual Currency equal to the product of (i) the Notional Amount and (ii) the Strike Amount Differential, which amount shall be due and payable on the applicable Payment Date, provided, however, that the maximum amount payable by the Floating Amount Payer shall not exceed Maximum Payout Limit, or 
negative number, the Fixed Amount Payer shall pay the Floating Amount Payer an absolute amount in the Contractual Currency equal to the product of (i) the Notional Amount and (ii) the Strike Amount Differential, which amount shall be due and payable on the applicable Payment Date, provided, however, that the maximum amount payable by the Fixed Amount Payer shall not exceed Maximum Payout Limit.
