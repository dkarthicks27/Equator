GRAY DAVIS, Governor -.-,

June 15, 2001
Market Participants:
This letter is to update you about the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund (DWREPF) that was established on January 19, 2001, and trades under the WSPP ID "CERS".
On January 19, 2001, Senate Bill 7X was enacted, appropriating $400 million to DWREPF. On February 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 1X was enacted, appropriating $500 million to DWREPF. The legislation allows for the appropriation of additional funds by the Director of Finance with a 10-day notice to the Legislature. Through May 31, 2001, an additional $6 billion had been authorized using this procedure. A summary financial report of DWREPF as May 31, 2001 is attached.
The Director of Finance is able to appropriate additional monies to the DWREPF without Legislative authorization. This is accomplished through the issuance of notification to the Legislature ten days before the funds are needed for additional power purchase commitments. It would take legislation, signed by the Governor, to remove the authority granted to the Director of Finance to increase appropriations to DWREPF. No such legislation is under consideration.
DWREPF continues to receive monies from Pacific Gas and-Electric Company (PG&E), Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric under California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) Decision 01-03-081, dated March 27, 2001. This decision requires the investor owned utilities to make payments, at specified rates for megawatt hours delivered, to DWREPF 45 days after delivery to end-use customers. Through May 31, 2001, DWREPF had received $768 million from the investor owned utilities. The payments received to date include monies received daily from PG&E since it filed for bankruptcy. The Chapter 11 filing by PG&E in no way relieves the utility of its obligation to comply with the CPUC's order to remit payments for power provided by the DWREPF.
Through May 31, 2001, DWREPF had committed $7.651 billion for power, purchases of which $5.944 billion has already been paid, leaving $1.707 billion in cash to pay for power already purchased. As of May 31, 2001, DWREPF had nearly $440 million available for purchasing power. As of the date of this letter, an additional $1 billion for power purchases has been made available to DWREPF as a result of additional funds being appropriated by the Director of Finance.
