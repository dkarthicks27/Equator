Leslie, 

Willis Philip has informed me that Rob Benson will be using the PJM West Fin index.  I will delete the highlighted sentence regarding the physical product.  Could you please reply and copy Mark Taylor giving your approval of the product type.  Thanks for all your help.

Attached please find the revised US Fin Pwr Spread.  I have hilighted the language that provides that the fixed price for the second transaction will be the midpoint of the bid and offer prices for physical power.  Simply delete the hilighted language if the traders decide to base the fixed price on the midpoint of the financial swap instead.

Note that I made changes to the index language as well as numerous changes to the product long description itself. 

Regards, 

Leslie
