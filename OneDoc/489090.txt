	Re:	Puget Sound Energy, Inc., v. All Jurisdictional Sellers, Docket Nos. EL01-10-000 and EL01-10-001

Dear Judge Cintron:

I write to inform you that Enron Power Marketing and Enron Energy Services (jointly "Enron"), respondents in the captioned case, are unable to make the data submission on their Pacific Northwest power sales that was scheduled for today.  Since the first pre-hearing in this case, Enron has deployed two teams of accountants and economists to analyze nearly 14 million data entries that may fall within the scope of the data submission template that you prescribed on August 9.  Despite their efforts (which during the past week have been ongoing 24 hours per day), we learned today, in connection with exercises to cross-check the accuracy of the data, that there are discrepancies in the data.  We are presently trying to find the source of the discrepancies.  However, Enron presently is unable to represent with confidence that any submission we could now make would be accurate.

	Please rest assured that our two teams of analysts are working assiduously to cure the discrepancies and that Enron will make a submission of accurate information on its Pacific Northwest sales just as soon as it is able.  I shall personally keep you and the Commission staff assigned to this case abreast of our progress.

						Very truly yours, 

						Bracewell & Patterson, L.L.P.
