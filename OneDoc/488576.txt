SINGAPORE, Aug. 14, 2001 (Dow Jones)--Indonesian pulp prices have bottomed out, with further recovery expected in the fourth quarter, the Indonesian Pulp & Paper Association told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday. 
"Pulp prices have already hit rock bottom," Muhammad Mansur, chairman of the association said, quoting Indonesian hardwood pulp at a low of $330 a metric ton "several weeks ago." 
"Now it is around $380/ton, and we're expecting prices in the fourth quarter to rise up to $400/ton-$420/ton," he said.
