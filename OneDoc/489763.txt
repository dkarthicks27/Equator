MS MICHELLE HOOGENDAM CASH, ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL
ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP
1400 SMITH ST
HOUSTON, TX  77002-7361

DEAR MS. CASH:

THE PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER IS TO DISPUTE THE VALIDITY OF YOUR CLAIM THAT I OWE ENRON $14,555.00.  THE FOLLOWING WILL OUTLINE MY POSITION IN THE MATTER.

FIRST OF ALL, I DID NOT ASK ENRON OR ASSOCIATES RELOCATION TO PLACE ANY FUNDS IN MY ACCOUNT.  THE RELOCATION PEOPLE ASKED ME FOR MY ACCOUNT INFORMATION SO THEY COULD PLACE AN AMOUNT IN MY ACCOUNT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RELOCATION EXPENSES.  THIS AMOUNT WAS NEVER DISCLOSED TO ME AND I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE AMOUNT WOULD BE THE $6,000.00 THAT THE OFFER LETTER SPOKE OF.  

IF ANY AMOUNT WAS PLACED IN MY BANK ACCOUNT IS WAS AT ENRON’S OWN FREE WILL AND WAS NOT ASK FOR OR SOLICITED BY ME IN ANY WAY NOR DID I SIGN FOR ANY MONIES OR ANY ARTICLE OBLIGATING ME TO FUNDS IN ANY AMOUNT.   THE OFFER LETTER SPOKE OF REPAYMENT TERMS IF I LEFT ENRON’S EMPLOY BEFORE CERTAIN DATES.  THE LETTER MAKES NO REMARKS ABOUT HOW ANY MOVING EXPENSES WERE TO BE REPAID IF THE OFFER WAS RESCINDED.  

BASED UPON ENRON’S ADVISE TO ME FROM SEVERAL PERSONS IN THE HUMAN RESOURCES AND FREIGHT MARKET DEPARTMENTS, I RESIGNED MY POSITION AT MY EMPLOYER AND INCURRED SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS EXPENSE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE IN HOUSTON.  AFTER RESIGNING I WAS OUT OF WORK OVER 6 WEEKS AND MISSED OUT ON SEVERAL BONUSES TOTALING OVER $10,000.00.  HOW WAS ENRON PLANNING TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THESE EXPENSES THAT THEY CAUSED?


THEREFORE, I DO NOT OWE ENRON OR ASSOCIATES RELOCATION ANY AMOUNT AND I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR UNSOLICITED MONEY PLACED ON MY BANK ACCOUNT.  YOU PLACED IT THERE AT YOUR OWN PERIL.  IF YOU CONTINUE TO HARASS ME I WILL HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER IN A COURT OF LAW.   


SINCERELY:
