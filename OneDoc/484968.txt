SQUARE SET OFF PROVISION

Section •

•.1	In this Section:

"Aggregate Obligations to Group X" means the aggregate of the Obligations of each Group Y Entity to each Group X Entity;
"Group X" means X and each Affiliate of X which is a party to this Agreement;
"Group X Entity" means any of the entities comprising Group X;
“Group Y” means Y and each Affiliate of Y which is a party to this Agreement;
“Group Y Entity” means any of the entities comprising Group Y;
"X" means the Non-defaulting Party; and
"Y" means the Defaulting Party.

•.2	Each of the Parties represents, acknowledges and agrees that:
the rights set forth in this Section • constitute an integral part of this Agreement and that without such rights the Parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions; and
upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default by or in respect of Y:
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s) to which any Enron Party and Counterparty Party are parties, each Group Y Entity shall be liable to each Group X Entity for Group Y's Aggregate Obligations to Group X, including any Obligations then existing, or incurred thereafter, by any Group Y Entity, provided however that Group Y’s aggregate liability under this paragraph • .2(b)(i) shall not exceed Group Y’s Aggregate Obligations to Group X; and
except as provided in paragraph •.3(b), each Group Y Entity is nonetheless directed (to continue) to pay its payment Obligations to each Group X Entity in accordance with the terms of the agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s) providing for such payment Obligations.

•.3	Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s) to which any Enron Party and Counterparty Party are parties, upon (or at any time(s) after) the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, Group X may, at its option, in its discretion and without prior notice:
setoff (including by set-off, offset, combination of accounts, retention, or withholding across or within each or all of the Underlying Master Agreements) against any Obligations of any Group X Entity to any Group Y Entity, all or any portion of Group Y’s Aggregate Obligations to Group X; and/or
direct any Group Y Entity to pay to any person designated by Group X, any payment Obligations of that Group Y Entity to any Group X Entity.
Obligations between each Group Y Entity and each Group X Entity shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by Group X.  Group X will give Group Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.

•.4	Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section • may be converted by Group X into any currency in which any Obligation owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which Group X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted, calculated as at the date such setoff is exercised.  If an Obligation is unfixed, contingent, unliquidated or unascertained, Group X may in good faith estimate that Obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the Obligation is fixed, ascertained, liquidated and/or no longer contingent.  Nothing in this Section • shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law [note –still under consideration].  This Section • shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, offset, combination of accounts, deductions, counterclaim, lien, retention, withholding or other right to which any Group X Entity is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  

•.5	Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s) to which any Enron Party and Counterparty Party are parties, upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, none of the entities comprising Group X shall be required to pay to any Group Y Entity any amount until each Group X Entity receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that Group Y’s Aggregate Obligations to Group X have been fully and finally satisfied.
