Items to be addressed Action Step Target Date Responsible Party A From December 2000 to March 2001, the Commodity Exchange receivable balance increased from $471M to $960M and the matching payable increased from $500M to $987M.  Due to the nature of these accounts, a majority of the receivable and payable balances should be netted by counterparty to properly state the net exchange balance.  In addition, activity from 1995 is included in this account.  Finally, there will be a P&L effect due to the difference in WACOG from the point of the imbalance to when it is settled.  This balance should be monitored on a monthly basis to ensure proper set-off and timely reconciliation. Enron should implement a systematic process to net imbalances as opposed to the manual process currently in place. B In 2001, the Company entered into two contracts that are intended to be cash flow hedges under SFAS 133.  As of August 1, 2001, the required documentation and effectiveness tests have not been completed. In order to comply with the provisions of SFAS 133, the documentation and hedge effectiveness tests should be completed at inception of hedge designation.

Items to be addressed Action Step Target Date Responsible Party C ·   A derivative instrument that does not qualify as a hedge is currently maintained in an accrual book and is therefore not included in daily position limits or  V@R reporting. ·   Specifically, the  Bammel monetization was restructured in 2 nd  Qtr 2001 which reduced the contractual long gas position from 80 Bcf to 55  Bcf.  In order to prevent the financial gas book from decreasing the net open position by 25  Bcf as a result of this transaction, an accrual book was created to hold a short 25  Bcf position. ·   Accrual books should only include properly designated hedges as opposed to other derivative instruments. ·   The financial gas book should reflect the reduction from 80  Bcf to 55  Bcf.  An  interbook swap should then be written between the financial and management books which would keep the total volumetric position for the financial book at 80  Bcf while creating at short 25  Bcf position in the management book.  As a result, the net position would be 55  Bcf and the value would be included in V@R.

Items to be addressed Action Step Target Date Responsible Party D Legal does not maintain  a  repository of approved confirmation templates. Legal should maintain copies of approved confirmation templates and periodically review confirmations (i.e. semi-annually or annually) sent to counterparties to ensure that the wording is current and applicable. In addition, for confirmations that require changes or additional verbiage to be added, management should determine the necessary documentation to be maintained in order to verify that legal has reviewed and approved those applicable confirmations.

Items to be addressed Action Step Target Date Responsible Party E Application development has access to the production environment. The development team has limited this access to one individual responsible for migrating application changes from the test environment to the production environment.  By allowing development access to the production environment, management has limited assurance that the integrity of the data is maintained. The development team should create tools to allow the Application Migration and Change Management Group to migrate all Sitara application changes, thereby eliminating the need for developer access to the production environment. F Users are not required to change their passwords every 90 days in accordance with the Enron Minimum IT Control Standards. By not complying with access and security minimum standards, management has limited assurance that data integrity is not compromised. Password rotation should be enforced in accordance with the Enron Minimum IT Control Standards.

Items to be addressed Action Step A In 2001, the Company marked 2.9  Bcf of pad gas in  Napoleonville to a forward curve and then subsequently hedged the value of the pad gas.  Based on EITF 98-10, it is improper to record pad gas at forward value. The company should reverse the $3.5  M  impact of marking the Napoleonville pad gas to the forward curve. B Currently, there is not a consistent reconciliation process in place to ensure changes to long-term physical deals are input into both TAGG/ERMS and  Sitara.  As a result, changes to these deals could result in inaccurate valuation or inaccurate logistical information. A process should be developed in which change/modifications to long-term physical deals are captured in both  Tagg and Sitara. C There are no formal or consistent procedures in place to monitor minimum and maximum volumetric requirements as stated in executed contracts. Management should review the Global Contracts Database to determine if the system has the ability to capture this data and produce reports that will assist in monitoring these commitments by specific counterparty contract.  Absent appropriate monitoring controls, management is unable to assess potential counterparty penalties.  All contractual obligations should be monitored periodically if the current automated environment does not support real-time monitoring procedures.

Items to be addressed Action Step D There is not a process in place to ensure that all trading transactions are assigned to the trader that executed the trade.  As such, transactions can be entered into the system without an appropriate audit trail of the responsible party. Currently, each book in the gas portfolio is designated to one trader, however the applicable trader name is not  a required field in the deal capture system.  With the implementation of the new Risk Management Policy, each gas position shall be designated to the applicable trader or corresponding risk manager for ongoing position management.  If different traders are allowed to trade different books, then the trader name should be a required field in the deal capture system, thereby properly identifying the responsible party and staying in compliance with the Risk Management Policy.
