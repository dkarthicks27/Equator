Mr. Peter Cartwright
President and CEO
Calpine Corporation
Corporate Headquarters
50 West San Fernando Street
San Jose, California, 95113

Dear Peter,

It is wit considerable regret that I must write you to request that Calpine voluntarily agree to adjust or renegotiate some provisions of your state contracts which are frankly unconscionable.  These provisions jeopardize Calpine’s excellent corporate reputation and could cast a financial cloud over the positive aspects of some of your agreements.

xxx of your contracts reflect a public interest sensitivity not found in some of the worst of the power contracts:

They assume the risk of future natural gas price spikes and protect consumers from volatile future gas prices.

They significantly increase the state’s supply of clean power natural gas facilities.

However, the provisions of the Los Esteros Project are simply too rich.  The contract is a three-year contract, after which the power will be sold into the market or used by the host at US Dataport ,.   Unless this agreement is altered, the 220 MW combined cycle Los Esteros Project may become one of the Poster Children of the state’s contractual excesses.  

As you know, Calpine’s capacity payments under its three-year contract  with the Department of Water Resources will pay a total of $148.7 million in capacity payments for 11 months of simple-cycle peaking operation and 25 months of combined cycle operation or $676 per kW.  We believe that this amount of money basically is the equivalent of 100% of the construction costs of the Los Esteros project,.  1 The contract also contains a relatively generous amount for variable O&M ($4/MWH, compared to the $2/MWh estimated by the CEC).
The California Energy Commission estimates the costs of a full combined cycle generating plant at about  $654/kW (year 2003 dollars).

The 20-year contract to build 495 MW of peaking generation should also be revised. We estimate the state’s payments for these plants over 20 years amount to over a billion and half dollars ($1,548 million (nominal) or $691 million (net present value at 10%) for plants that have a total cost of $400-$500/kW or $200 to $250 million.  This is more than twice the payments that would be made to a regulated utility building the same plant . Even after factoring in factor in consideration for income taxes, we have calculated that Calpine will receive a return in excess of 32% on the total cost of the peakers – higher if debt leverage can be used.  Calpine also receives $73/MWh every time one of these units is turned on – another windfall unless gas prices are substantially above $6/MMBtu.

Finally, while the existing combined cycle contracts appear to be priced relatively competitively, the 2000 MW size of the contract, the eleven-year length of the contract and the 100% capacity factor deliveries required all have the effect of limiting the State’s flexibility to deal with changing circumstances.

In short, we urge you to voluntarily agree to shorten the 20-year peaker contract, increase the flexibility and dispatchability of other gas-fired contracts and reduce the excessive costs of both Los Esteros and the peakers.  The Calpine contracts are the first to receive our review.  We plan to carry out an intense public education campaign aimed at the worst provisions of the worst contracts.  We plan to add a new power contract and company each week during the initial stage of this effort.   I look forward to your response.
