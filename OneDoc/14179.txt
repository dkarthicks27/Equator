Re: the Statoil Assignment

The Statoil master will not be terminated. They sold their existing natgas & 
crude oil book to J. Aron.  They may trade other products out of that master, 
or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those 
products.  So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under 
the J. Aron master.  Everything else should remain the same.
