	(b)	Agreement To Arbitrate:  Any claim, counterclaim, demand, cause of action, dispute, and controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the relationship established by this Agreement, any provision hereof, the alleged breach thereof, or in any way relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, involving the parties and/or their respective representatives (collectively the "Claims"), even though some or all of such Claims allegedly are extra-contractual in nature, whether such Claims sound in contract, tort, or otherwise, at law or in equity, under state or federal law, whether provided by statute or the common law, for damages or any other relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration.

Conduct Of The Arbitration, And Authority Of The Arbitrators:  Arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The validity, construction, and interpretation of this agreement to arbitrate, and all procedural aspects of the arbitration conducted pursuant hereto shall be decided by the arbitrators.  In deciding the substance of the parties' Claims, the arbitrators shall refer to the Governing Law.

(h)	Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, "X") may, at its option and in its discretion (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party), Setoff, against any amounts owed whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, "Y") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or otherwise, any amounts owed whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of its Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or otherwise.  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such Setoff.  For this purpose, the amounts subject to the Setoff to the extent necessary may be converted by X into the Termination Currency at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  X will give Y notice of any Setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the Setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the Setoff.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing herein shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest.  This Setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of Setoff, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).
(B)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or otherwise which are due and payable as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally performed or discharged, whether by Setoff or otherwise.
(i)	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NO PARTY SHALL BE REQUIRED TO PAY OR BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ITS NEGLIGENCE) TO ANY OTHER PARTY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF AND TO THE EXTENT ANY PAYMENT REQUIRED TO BE MADE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT SUCH PAYMENT IS INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE AND GENUINE PRE-ESTIMATE AND APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOT A PENALTY.

"For purposes of this Section, the non-transferring party's withholding of consent to a proposed transfer will not be deemed to be unreasonable if, without limitation: (1) an Event of Default, Potential Event of Default or Termination Event with respect to the transferring party or the proposed transferee will exist following such transfer, (2) the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee is materially weaker than that of the transferring party immediately prior to such transfer, unless the transferring party provides a satisfactory (to the non-transferring party) guaranty or credit support to the non-transferring party  (or if the transferring party has a Credit Support Provider and the transfer is to a party other than such Credit Support Provider, unless such Credit Support Provider provides a satisfactory (to the non-transferring party) Credit Support Document to the non-transferring party or its existing Credit Support Document remains in full force and effect); (3) on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date, the non-transferring party will be required to gross up its payments to the proposed transferee or receive payments form the proposed transferee net of withholding or deduction that would not otherwise be required hereunder or under applicable law in the absence of the proposed transfer; (4) the proposed transferee and its Credit Support Provider, if any , do not satisfy the criteria that the non-transferring party applies in deciding whether to offer or make an extension of credit or enter into transactions similar to the Transactions subject to the proposed transfer; (5) or the proposed transfer would adversely affect the non-transferring party's netting rights hereunder or under applicable law."

All terms used in this Part 6 that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Commodity Definitions.

(b)	In lieu of Section 7.4(d) of the Commodity Definitions, the "Market Disruption Events" specified in Section 7.4(c)(i), (c)(ii), (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v) and (c)(viii) of the Commodity Definitions shall apply, except as otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation.

(c)	Section 7.4(c)(viii) of the Commodity Definitions is hereby amended by the addition of the following at the end thereof:

"For these purposes, a limitation of trading on any Commodity Business Day shall be deemed to be material only if the relevant Exchange establishes limits on the range within which the price of the Futures Contract may fluctuate in the first nearby month and the closing or settlement price of such Futures Contract on such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range."

(d)	Section 7.5(e) of the Commodity Definitions is hereby deleted.

(e)	"Additional Market Disruption Events" shall apply only if so specified in the relevant Confirmation.

(f)	The following "Disruption Fallbacks" specified in Section 7.5(c) of the Commodity Definitions shall apply, in the following order, except as otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation:

(i)	"Postponement", with three (3) Commodity Business Days as the Maximum Days of Disruption;

(ii)	"Fallback Reference Price" (if the relevant parties have specified an alternate Commodity Reference Price in the Confirmation);

(iii)	"Negotiated Fallback" (provided that the reference in Section 7.5(c)(iv) to "fifth Business Day" shall be amended to be "twelfth Business Day"); and

(iv)	"Fallback Reference Dealers"; provided, however, notwithstanding any reference to the number of Specified Prices the definition of "Commodity Reference Dealers" set forth in Section 7.1(d)(i) of the Commodity Definitions, Party A and Party B shall each obtain in good faith quotations from a leading dealer in the relevant market and the price for that Pricing Date will be the arithmetic mean of the Specified Prices, provided that if Party B is unable to obtain a quotation or fails to designate a Reference Dealer within three Business Days of the Calculation Agent's request, then Party A shall obtain, in good faith, a substitute quotation from different leading dealer.

(g)	For purposes of any Transaction in which paper or pulp is the relevant Commodity, the phrase "within 30 calendar days" in line 5 of Section 7.3 of the Commodity Definitions shall be replaced by the phrase "within 40 calendar days."

(h)	For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant Commodity is traded in a market that is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; (ii) it may be more difficult for it to obtain quotations from a marketmaker or other dealer that is not a party to the Transaction and consequently to establish an independent value for the Transaction; (iii) any prices or terms quoted by Party A for entering into, modifying, or terminating a Transaction, although based upon what Party A believes to be a commercially reasonable valuation methodology, may be different than if this market were more mature and liquid; and (iv) any valuations which may be provided by Party A do not necessarily reflect Party A's internal bookkeeping or theoretical model-based valuations of the Transaction and may reflect other factors, including without limitation the creditworthiness of a counterparty, costs of carry, use of capital, and profit.

EXECUTED effective as of the date first written above.

In such examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to us as certified or otherwise satisfactorily identified copies.  We have also assumed that the Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by you pursuant to appropriate corporate authority.  The opinions given below are limited to matters concerning the laws of the                                            .

		Based upon the foregoing and having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, we are of opinion that:

	1.  The Counterparty is a __________________ duly existing under the laws of ________________.

	2.  The Counterparty has full corporate power to execute and deliver the Agreement and to perform its obligations thereunder.

	3.  Such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and do not violate, and are not in conflict with any provision of law or of the corporate charter and related documents of the Counterparty.

	4.  All authorizations of, exemptions by and filings with any governmental, regulatory body or other authority that are required to be obtained or made in connection with the Counterparty's execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement have been obtained or made and are valid and subsisting.

	5.  The Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Counterparty and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Counterparty enforceable against the Counterparty in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect).  Obligations of any branch of the Counterparty are for all purposes obligations of the Counterparty, enforceable against the Counterparty to the same extent set forth in the next preceding sentence.  The enforceability of the Counterparty's obligations is also subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

	6.  The choice of law provision set forth in the Agreement is valid and binding under the laws of ________________ and any political subdivision thereof and would be given effect by the courts of __________________ and any political subdivision thereof.

(1) Party A is not a Defaulting Party and an Additional Termination Event has not occurred. 
(2) Posted Collateral may be held only in the following jurisdictions:  Any jurisdiction within the United States.
(3) The Custodian is a Qualified Institution (as defined below), approved by Party B (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Custodian shall hold the Posted Collateral in a segregated, safekeeping or custody account within the Custodian with the title of such account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the ownership of Party B, subject to the security interest of Party A.

If a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to this Section, then it shall be considered a "Downgraded Party" or a "Downgraded Custodian", as the case may be (as defined in Paragraph 13(g)(ii)) and Posted Collateral shall be maintained in accordance with Paragraph 13(g)(ii).

(ii)  Use of Posted Collateral.

The provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will apply to the parties; provided, however, that if a party or its Custodian is not eligible to hold Posted Collateral pursuant to Paragraph 13(g)(i) (the event that caused it or its Custodian, if any, to be ineligible to hold Posted Collateral shall be a "Credit Rating Event"; if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party, such party shall be the "Downgraded Party"; and if such Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party's Custodian, such Custodian shall be the "Downgraded Custodian"), then:

(1)  the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) will not apply with respect to the Downgraded Party as the Secured Party for so long as both the Secured Party or its Custodian, if any, remain a Downgraded Party or a Downgraded Custodian, respectively.

(2)  the Downgraded Party shall be required to deliver (or cause the Downgraded Custodian to deliver, as the case may be) not later than the close of business on the second Local Business Day following such Credit Rating Event all Posted Collateral in its possession or held on its behalf to a commercial bank or trust company organized under the law of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, with a Credit Rating of at least "A-" in the case of S&P or "A3" in the case of Moody's ("Qualified Institution"), approved by the non-Downgraded Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) to a segregated, safekeeping or custody account ("Collateral Account") within such Qualified Institution with the title of the Collateral Account indicating that the property contained therein is being held as Posted Collateral for the Downgraded Party; provided, that, if the Credit Rating Event occurs with respect to a party's Custodian that is holding Posted Collateral on behalf of such party, then such party may cause such Downgraded Custodian to deliver such Posted Collateral to such party.  The Qualified Institution shall serve as Custodian with respect to the Posted Collateral in the Collateral Account, and shall hold such Posted Collateral in accordance with the terms of this Annex and for the security interest of the Downgraded Party and, subject to such security interest, for the ownership of the non-Downgraded Party.

(3)   So long as the provisions of Paragraph 6(c) do not apply, the Qualified Institution holding the Posted Collateral will invest and reinvest or procure the investment and reinvestment of the Posted Collateral in accordance with the written instructions of the Pledgor, subject to the approval of such instructions by the Secured Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that the Qualified Institution shall not be required to so invest or reinvest or procure such investment or reinvestment if an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or Specified Condition with respect to the Pledgor shall have occurred and be continuing.  The Secured Party shall have no responsibility for any losses resulting from any investment or reinvestment effected in accordance with the Pledgor's instructions.

(iii)  For purposes of Section 5(a)(iii) of this Agreement, failure by a party or its Custodian to comply with any of the obligations under this Paragraph 13(g) will constitute an Event of Default with respect to such party if the failure continues for two (2) Local Business Days after notice of the failure is given to that party.

(h)	Distributions and Interest Amount.

(i)  Interest Rate.  The "Interest Rate" will be:  Federal Funds Effective Rate as from time to time in effect.

(ii)  Transfer of Interest Amount.  The Transfer of the Interest Amount will be made on the last Local Business Day of each calendar month and on any Local Business Day that Posted Collateral in the form of Cash is Transferred to the Pledgor pursuant to Paragraph 3(b).  If Transfer of an Interest Amount (or any portion thereof) to a Pledgor on any day would result in, or increase, a Delivery Amount (treating the day as a Valuation Date, as provided in Paragraph 6(d)(ii)) but the Pledgor would nonetheless have no obligation to make a Transfer pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) on that day if it were a Valuation Date (because the Delivery Amount is lower than the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount or otherwise), the Secured Party will be required to Transfer that Interest Amount (or portion thereof) to the Pledgor, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 6(d)(ii).

(i)	Demands and Notices.

All demands, specifications, and notices under this Annex will be made pursuant to the Notices Section of this Agreement.

(j)	Addresses for Transfers.

Party A:     To be provided in notice requesting delivery/return of Eligible Credit Support/Posted Credit Support.

Party B:      To be provided in notice requesting delivery/return of Eligible Credit Support/Posted Credit Support.

(k)	Other Provisions.

(i)  Paragraph 12 of this Annex is hereby amended by adding the following:

"Credit Rating" means with respect to a party (or its Credit Support Provider, as the case may be) or entity, on any date of determination, the respective ratings then assigned to such party's (or its Credit Support Provider's, as the case may be) or entity's unsecured, senior long-term debt or deposit obligations (not supported by third party credit enhancement) by S&P, Moody's or the other specified rating agency or agencies.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, Catequil Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Counterparty"), and ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. ("Enron"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor, are contemplating entering into one or more swap, option or other financially-settled derivative transactions, which transactions will be evidenced by one or more swap agreements, confirmations and/or master agreements, including without limitation, the Master Agreement of even date herewith (the "Master Agreement") (all such swap, option or other derivative transactions and the agreements evidencing same, including without limitation, the Master Agreement, whether entered into prior to, on or after the date hereof, as the same may from time to time be modified, amended and supplemented, shall be referred to herein collectively as the "Contract"); and 

WHEREAS, Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the transactions to be entered into between Enron and Counterparty;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of Counterparty entering into the Contract, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees as follows:

1.  GUARANTY.  Subject to the provisions hereof, Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the timely payment when due (whether at stated maturity, acceleration, or otherwise) of the obligations of Enron (the "Obligations") to Counterparty and its successors and assigns under the Contract (without any deduction or withholding except as provided in the Contract) and Guarantor shall pay all expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) incurred by Counterparty in enforcing its rights under this Guaranty should Guarantor be required to pay hereunder.  This Guaranty shall constitute a guarantee of payment and not of collection.  The liability of Guarantor under the Guaranty shall be subject to the following:
(a)  Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be and is specifically limited to payments expressly required to be made under the Contract (even if such payments are deemed to be damages) and, except to the extent specifically provided in the Contract, in no event shall Guarantor be subject hereunder to consequential, exemplary, equitable, loss of profits, punitive, tort, or any other damages, costs, or attorney's fees.
(b)    The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty shall not exceed U.S. $10,000,000.
(c)  Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall be irrevocable, continuing and unconditional, and shall not be dicharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the Contract, irrespective of any claim as to the Contract's validity, regularity, or enforcability or lack of authority of Counterparty to execute or deliver the Contract; or any waiver or consent by Counterparty with respect to any provision thereof; or the absence of any action to enforce the Contract, or the recovery of any judgment against the Counterparty or of any action to enforce a judgement against the Counterparty; or any similar circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor generally.

(d)    If at any time payment under the Contract is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned by Counterparty as a result of insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Enron, Guarantor or otherwise, Guarantor's obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated upon such restoration or return being made by Counterparty.

2.  DEMANDS AND NOTICE.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default or Termination Event, if Enron fails or refuses to pay any Obligations and Counterparty has elected to exercise its rights under this Guaranty, Counterparty shall make a demand upon Guarantor (hereinafter referred to as a "Payment Demand").  A Payment Demand shall be in writing and shall reasonably and briefly specify in what manner and what amount Enron has failed to pay and an explanation of why such payment is due, with a specific statement that Counterparty is calling upon Guarantor to pay under this Guaranty. A Payment Demand satisfying the foregoing requirements shall be required with respect to Obligations before Guarantor is required to pay such Obligations hereunder and shall be deemed sufficient notice to Guarantor that it must pay the Obligations within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the Payment Demand. A single written Payment Demand shall be effective as to any specific default during the continuance of such default, until Enron or Guarantor has cured such default, and additional written demands concerning such default shall not be required until such default is cured.

3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:
(a)  it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of Oregon and has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of the Guaranty; 
(b)  no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty; and
(c)  this Guaranty, when executed and delivered, will constitute a valid and legally binding agreement of Guarantor, except as the enforceability of this Guaranty may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

4.  SETOFFS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.  Without limiting Guarantor's own defenses and rights hereunder, but subject to the other provisions hereof, Guarantor reserves to itself all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other similar defenses to which Enron is entitled to arising from or out of the Contract or otherwise, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Enron.

5.  AMENDMENT OF GUARANTY.  No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

6.  WAIVERS.  Guarantor hereby waives (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) presentment and demand concerning the liabilities of Guarantor, except as expressly hereinabove set forth; and (c) any right to require that any action or proceeding be brought against Enron or any other person, or except as expressly hereinabove set forth, to require that Counterparty seek enforcement of any performance against Enron or any other person, prior to any action against Guarantor under the terms hereof.

Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration or other changes in the time of payment of or other changes in the terms of the Obligations, or any part thereof or any changes or modifications to the terms of the Contract.

Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written notice of such termination to Counterparty and upon the effectiveness of such termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination shall be effective until five (5) Business Days after receipt by Counterparty of such termination notice.  No such termination shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect to any Transaction (as defined in the Contract) entered into prior to the time the termination is effective, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guaranty.
