That, my man, is the $64 question.  Kim and Rockie are nailing this down 
first thing monday AM.  The result of our conversation on Friday with Conoco 
was that if we own it, they want it, and if we don't own it, we'd better not 
convey it to them.  Clever devils, they are forcing us to determine exactly 
what it is that we own!  Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

There is a 6" lateral pipeline located in Sec. 34-T18S, R36E, Lea County,
NM.  If this is part of the deal I will need to see the right-of-way
documentation for this pipeline.
