Benefits of STRATIS
Individual tax basis of each position starts with the initial investment.  There are no built-up capital gains, as with a fund.
You can request specific restrictions by security, industry or category:
For example, you can request that no tobacco or employer’s stock be included in your portfolio.
Your portfolio is portable:
You can leave the program and take your securities with you to another firm without incurring any taxable events or                                                             transaction costs.

The STRATIS Process
Benefits of Diversification
Different asset classes and investment approaches produce different results as economic and market conditions change.
By taking full advantage of STRATIS’ multi-manager program, you increase the potential to achieve higher returns per unit of risk on your portfolio.
Of course, you may also use STRATIS for only one or two asset classes to complement investments you have outside STRATIS.

2.  Investment Strategy





kpmg
The STRATIS Process
The investment managers in the STRATIS program have passed a comprehensive screening conducted by KPMG.
The principal criteria employed in narrowing the universe of money managers were:
Consistency of investment performance under varying market conditions
Constancy of investment policy and security selection process
Growth of assets under management
Continuity of investment personnel
Administrative efficiency
Commitment to client service

3.  Manager Selection





kpmg
The STRATIS Process
To select the managers for your portfolio, you will receive a detailed profile of each of the investment managers.
After reviewing the profiles with your representative, you will then choose from among those investment managers whose style(s) best suit your portfolio.
KPMG evaluates the performance of each manager on a quarterly basis and conducts an annual analysis to assess the level of risk assumed and the consistency of investment style.
If there are any significant changes that cause concern, the manager may be replaced in the program by Bear Stearns Asset Management.
