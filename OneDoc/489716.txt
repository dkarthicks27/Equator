Mike-

We visited AA yesterday in Dallas and they are going to allow Enron to compete for derivative business with them. Where do we stand with an ISDA with them? They mentioned that all the others they have in place are very generic - I don't know what our unique changes are, but if there is nothing in the works, the proper person to forward it to would be either:

Leslie Benners				Geraldine Lim
Managing Director			Principal
Corporate Finance & Banking		Corporate Finance
4333 Amon Carter Blvd			4333 Amon Carter Blvd			
Mail Drop 5662				Mail Drop 5662
Ft. Worth, TX  76155			Ft. Worth, TX  76155

Leslie is the boss, Geraldine is the one who will be responsible for trading derivatives, but is in the job only in the last month. 

Let me know, thanks...
