	The majority of my time with the coal and emissions group was spent doing short-term research projects on emission credit markets for Trevor Woods.  Additionally, I assisted Laura in completing a number of research and data analysis projects and created a presentation on coal basics for future use by Salil’s coal fundamentals group.  My activities with the fundamentals group have centered around making improvements to a fuel switching model, but have also included data analysis on numerous commodities.
6/5-6/15
Conducted legal and market research on all TNRCC-created regional emissions markets.  I synthesized the legislation and identified its significance for trading possibilities in a report on the Houston Galveston (HGA) nonattainment region for ERC and DERC trading reference use.
Compiled a database of all probable major players in the HGA emissions market including plant, contact, and credit holdings information.
All of this work was eventually handed off to Laura for continuation once I began working with the egm fundamentals group.
6/18-6/22
Organized and inventoried San Joaquin emission credit holdings.  Researched current San Joaquin emissions credit market and identified possible buyers.  
Did odd jobs for Trevor and assisted Laura with modifications to the OTR model.
6/25-6/29
Created a listing and brief synopsis of regional emissions credit trading programs and accompanying legislation.  This project was also handed off to Laura once I began working with the fundamentals group. 
Researched possibilities of internal (within Enron Corp) emissions credit origination. 
7/2-7/6
Met with Vince Middleton (in Scott Affelt’s group) about the possibility of emissions credit creation resulting from the NoxTech group’s efforts.
Met with Heather Mitchell from EES about possible NOx emissions credit generation from the implementation of energy efficiency products. 
Met with Lisa Jacobson from environmental strategies about emissions credit generation from efficiency measures on the pipelines.
Began research on coal fundamentals and industry information in preparation for coal presentation for Salil.
7/9-720
 Researched and wrote “Coal 101” presentation.
Assisted Laura and Mike with emissions credit market research.
7/23-7/27
Began working with Jeff Andrews – researching possible improvements to fuel switching model.
Worked with Jason Sokolov to update and improve search capabilities of the Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) database.
7/30-8/3
Compiled data and conducted an analysis of average hourly capacity variance corresponding to peak power demand amongst coal-fired generators by NERC region.  I suggested to Bart Burk and Dipak Agarwalla (designers of the the fuel-switching model) an addition to their model that accounted for this analysis of the behavior of coal-fired generators.
Developed charts demonstrating the price sensitivity of switch capable plants to the 2 oil – natural gas and 6 oil – natural gas spreads by NERC region.
8/6-8/10
Continued gathering data on fuel price sensitivity of switch capable plants in FRCC, MAAC, NPCC, and ERCOT. 
Used information presented in charts of fuel price and fuel use data to frame a regression analysis of price/fuel use correspondence.  
8/13-8/17
Completed regression analysis – determined minimum price spreads necessary to force price-driven fuel usage decisions.
Incorporated minimum price spread thresholds between natural gas and both 2 and 6 oils into the fuel switching model for ERCOT, FRCC, MAAC, and NPCC.
Assisted Sunitinder (of the fundamentals group) in data analysis to be incorporated into a refinery model.
8/20-8/22/01
Continued data analysis to identify major drivers of crude product prices.
Compiled data and conducted regression analysis on heating oil and diesel price reactions to API stock estimates.
