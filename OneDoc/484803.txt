El Paso Natural Gas Company 
Responses to Questions Raised at
Docket No. RP00-336-000, et al. Technical Conference

Question No. 4:	How frequent are constraints at the 20 proposed pooling areas.  What is the volume of gas that may be received at these points? 

Response No. 4:	In order to answer this question, El Paso looked at allocations that were made in the scheduling process over the past twelve calendar months due to constraints at the locations that serve as the downstream boundaries of the proposed 20 pooling areas.  The figures contained in the table below, however, are not indicative of the constraints that would be experienced under El Paso's proposed method because a substantial majority of the incidents of capacity allocation that are identified thereon were the result of shippers using the systemwide receipt point flexibility currently available to them to nominate gas from preferred gas sources.  Once the allocation of primary receipt rights is completed and systemwide receipt points eliminated, the incidents of allocations at these potential constraint points will be drastically reduced.  The attached schedule lists the receipt points within each proposed pooling area, the design limit for each point and the maximum quantity scheduled at the receipt point during a recent 12-month period.
