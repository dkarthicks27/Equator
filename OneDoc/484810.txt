Responses to Questions Raised at
Docket No. RP00-336-000, et al. Technical Conference

Question No. 11: 	When could El Paso file an application for the conversion of Line No. 1903 to gas and an expansion of Line No. 2000 ("the power-up")?  

Response No. 11:	

Once El Paso determined to make such filings, El Paso could file an application for the conversion of Line No. 1903 to gas service by December 1, 2001; an application for the “power-up” of line 2000 would take approximately six months to prepare and file, i.e. March 1, 2002.
