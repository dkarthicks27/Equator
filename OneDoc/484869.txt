Subject:	Bev's Conversation w/Dunne

Dunne told Bev that he (the committee?) intends to take up the contempt vote against us as soon as possible in September.  Apparently, he thinks they will prevail in Superior Court.  
He also said that, even though there's been alot of paper submitted by the generators, it's his sense that many are not in compliance and that more tussles are likely.  
Finally, he said that he suspects that generators will sue the committee when the committee starts the deposition process in September.

Best,
Jeff
