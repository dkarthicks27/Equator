Dear Jeff:

I read in the newspaper that you have decided to leave Enron. I'm sure you
are receiving thousands of letters like mine from many admirers everywhere.
As I said to you on other occasions, I truly enjoyed serving on your
committee to select the new fire chief. Your talents and natural gifts are
so great that not having you at Enron will clearly be a huge loss for that
company and the rest of us in the Houston community.  Best of luck and
Godspeed in your next endeavor.   As I said to you the last time we spoke, I
still would like to find some way to be on your team in the future.
